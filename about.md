Hi! My name is Charlotte and this is where I write about things, mostly software engineering related. Content varies from my thoughts on culture issues to more technical writing on tips on python and other languages and tools I've had experience with.

I'm also interested in classical music and languages. If you have anything specific to say or points to contribute please feel free to tweet me, @charwarz.
