But I got bored. So I decided I'm going to write microbit battleship instead. 
Part of it is probably that I've never actually played Werewolf but the other part is having oodles of free time right now makes my attention span even shorter.
Anyhow, I think Battleship gives as much scope for radio use so we'll see how it goes.

Photo from my recent holiday to Tenerife. It was quite nice.
