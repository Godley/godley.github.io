From Tuesday to Wednesday I was in Hull, graduating. Really awesome couple of days, got photos with a lot of people in funny hats and all of it was free as I was lucky enough to win the NSS prize of robe hire and official photography nobody thinks exists.
My favourite photos:

The following day was my big sister's graduation in Newcastle, so we continued the fun by heading up there and finally coming back to reality this afternoon.

Fabulous week. Congratulations all!
