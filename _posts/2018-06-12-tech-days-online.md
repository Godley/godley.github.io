I was invited to speak about Container Orchestration at Microsoft Tech Days Online today. It was a lot of fun, there were some interesting points made and a good day overall. Thanks a lot to Gabriel for organising and for all the Microsoft cohort at the reactor for being so lovely all day :)

(Note that the youtube link above has very choppy sound due to it being from Youtube Live, I think that'll get fixed when they chop up the individual talks)
