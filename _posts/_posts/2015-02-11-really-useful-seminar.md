Today I did a really useful seminar. Basically, these are extra lectures spearheaded by Rob Miles which cover stuff that's generally useful to Computer Science students.

Personally, I spoke about my year's industrial placement, with advice on what to do and what not to do in the application process and some other funky stuff.
You can find the slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W6zCWUbzmyf_ANaf_wILYb4yOBtKJ2hP6fL075wDrHU/edit?usp=sharing), though as I don't really like writing a lot on slides I'll be doing a screencast at some stage.
