I was reading [this article](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/11/23/a-rebuttal-for-python-3/) today on Zed Shaw's tear down of why Python 3 is actually an inside job. He doesn't seem to understand typing so I thought I'd draw a diagram again.

Further addendum: no matter whether a byte string and a string look similar, they're different types. 

I did also get asked what's the main difference between C++ and Python and somehow thought variable privacy was more fundamental than typing so not sure what my brain was doing that day.
